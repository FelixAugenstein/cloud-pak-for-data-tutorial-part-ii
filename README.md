## Digital Tech Tutorial Watson Studio Part I to IV

This tutorial consists of 4 parts, you can start with part I or any other part, however, the necessary environment is set up in part I.<br>
[Part I - data visualization, preparation, and transformation](https://github.com/FelixAugenstein/digital-tech-tutorial-watson-studio)<br>
[Part II - build and evaluate machine learning models by using the AutoAI](https://github.com/FelixAugenstein/digital-tech-tutorial-watson-studio-part-ii/)<br>
[Part III](https://github.com/FelixAugenstein/digital-tech-tutorial-watson-studio-part-iii/)<br>
[Part IV](https://github.com/FelixAugenstein/digital-tech-tutorial-watson-studio-part-iv/)

The 4 parts of this tutorial are based on the [Learning path: Getting started with Watson Studio](https://developer.ibm.com/series/learning-path-watson-studio/).

## Create a new AutoAI model

1. Select the Assets tab for your Watson Studio project.
2. In the Asset tab, click the Add to Project command.
